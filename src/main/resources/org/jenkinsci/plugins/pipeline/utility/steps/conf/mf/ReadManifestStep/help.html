    file or text and parses it into a set of Maps.
    The returned data structure has two properties: <code>main</code> for the main attributes,
    and <code>entries</code> containing each individual section (except for main).

    <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
    <code>
        <pre>
            def man = readManifest file: 'target/my.jar'
            assert man.main['Version'] == '6.15.8'
            assert man.main['Application-Name'] == 'My App'
            assert man.entries['Section1']['Key1'] == 'value1-1'
            assert man.entries['Section2']['Key2'] == 'value2-2'
        </pre>
