<p>
    Reads a file in the current working directory or a String as a plain text <a href="http://yaml.org" target="_blank">YAML</a> file.
    It uses <a href="https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml" target="_blank">SnakeYAML</a> as YAML processor.
    The returned objects are standard Java objects like List, Long, String, ...:
		bool: [true, false, on, off]
		int: 42
		float: 3.14159
		list: ['LITE', 'RES_ACID', 'SUS_DEXT']
		map: {hp: 13, sp: 5}
</p>
<strong>Fields:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>file</code>:
        Optional path to a file in the workspace to read the YAML datas from.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>text</code>:
        An Optional String containing YAML formatted datas.
        <em>These are added to the resulting object after <code>file</code> and so will overwrite any value already present if not a new YAML document</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br/>
    With only one YAML document :
    <code>
        <pre>
        def datas = readYaml text: """
something: 'my datas'
size: 3
isEmpty: false
"""
        assert datas.something == 'my datas'
        assert datas.size == 3
        assert datas.isEmpty == false
        </pre>
    </code>
    With several YAML documents :
    <code>
        <pre>
        def datas = readYaml text: """
---
something: 'my first document'
---
something: 'my second document'
"""
        assert datas.size() == 2
        assert datas[0].something == 'my first document'
        assert datas[1].something == 'my second document'
        </pre>
    </code>
    With file dir/my.yml containing <code>something: 'my datas'</code> :
    <code>
        <pre>
        def datas = readYaml file: 'dir/my.yml', text: "something: 'Override'"
        assert datas.something == 'Override'
        </pre>
    </code>
