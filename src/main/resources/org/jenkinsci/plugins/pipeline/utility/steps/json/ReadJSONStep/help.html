        An Optional String containing properties formatted data.
        <em>These are added to the resulting map after <code>file</code> and so will overwrite any key/value pairs already present.</em>

    <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
    <code>
        def props = readJSON file: 'dir/input.json', text: '{ other: Override }'
        assert props['test'] == 'One'
        assert props.other == 'Override'
