# Pipeline Utility Steps Plugin
Small, miscellaneous, **cross platform** utility steps for [Jenkins Pipeline](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workflow+Plugin) jobs.

If you have an idea for a pipeline step implementation but don't have a specific plugin to put it in you can more than likely place it here.

See the [List of Steps](docs/STEPS.md) and the [changelog](CHANGES.md).

And the [wiki page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Utility+Steps+Plugin).
